T2DMit_Adventure_RPG_Toy
========================

The Adventure Toy is a Zelda1 type, using Zelda sprite like with a twist.  The RPG uses adventure resources for ease.  I may even just combine the two, I’m still undecided.

I’m posting all work here so others can see code for their use, and to help me with bugs.    Also if you have any resources you would like to add...  Like GUI’s, Sprite work, Effects, Etc.  I will have a folder Contribute/1/...your stuff so it can be called or used.  Please include a “Read me” with any details of what you done.  

My hope Ultimately is to have a Toy out of the box that others can use to make their own, with minimal changes.  A Project/Tool set would be nice for world building, tiles, etc.  With a final compile for game distribute.  With out having to have VS, T2d, etc, Make game... distribute game... for simple and advanced.    

I don’t want to reinvent the wheel... I see there is an Out of date kit on git hub, I will keep my eye on that ( TGB Adventure Kit Found here :: https://github.com/SickheadGames/AdventureKit )   I’m eager to work with the new T3Dmit.  

Thanks to all those at GG, and everyone who has help to make Torque so GR8 :)
